title: Midnight Changes
---

It is important to keep in mind that Midnight represents a big change in the design philosophy for healing, combat and class design. A lot of things are changing or going away and there is not a lot of new stuff added, but all of this is done in the context of a simpler and more straightforward game. There are a lot of things that were cool or nice to have but not really super important for moment to moment gameplay, and there where some effects that seemed interesting on the surface but ended up being chores during actual combat.

*Everyone* is losing things, but a lot of those things we are better without. Remember that specs are balanced according to the tools they have, losing an effect that increases your healing sometimes doesn't mean that you are now weaker, it just means that your baseline should be brought up a bit to keep you at the same relative level of power.

## Removed Spells

With that out of the way, this is a list of the spells being removed in Midnight:

- !Ancestral Protection Totem!
- !Earthen Wall Totem!
- Cloudburst Totem
- !Healing Surge!
- !High Tide!
- !Mana Tide!
- !Spiritwalkers Tidal Totem!
- !Master of the Elements!
- !Tidebringer!
- !Undulation!
- !Wellspring!
- !Totemic Recall!
- !Stone Bulwark Totem!
- !Thunderstorm!

## Spell Changes

And these are some of the existing things receiving significant changes:

- !Chain Heal! and !Healing Wave! have been rebalanced, they now have a 2 seconds cast time and their power has been adjusted so both spells heal for a similar total amount. !Chain Heal! is still very expensive mana wise and !Healing Wave! is still very cheap.
- !Ascendance! has been significantly reworked. Instead of replicating a percentage of your healing on allies around you, it now increases all your healing done by 30%, causes !Riptide! casts to make your next !Chain Heal! or !Healing Wave! instant, and makes !Chain Heal! and !Healing Wave! apply !Riptide! on their primary target. !Ascendance! still heals nearby allies on cast.
- !Ascendance! and !Healing Tide Totem! are now on a choice node.
- !Healing Rain! base duration and cooldown have been increased to 18 seconds up from 10. !Surging Totem! lasts for 25 seconds with a 25 second cooldown.
- !Unleash Life! now only works on !Riptide!, !Healing Wave! or !Chain Heal! and it is always just a flat healing increase and cast time reduction. It can no longer be used with !Healing Rain! or !Downpour!.
- !Therazanes Resilience! and !Reactive Warding! have been moved to the class tree.
- !Coalescing Water! is now weaker but also works on !Healing Wave! casts.
- !Downpour! no longer increases the health of the players it heals.

## New Additions

While there is not a lot of new things to talk about, there are several notable points that deserve mention. Some of these are key to how the spec will play out during Midnight and some others help us see what the new vision for talent and spell design is.

The main new thing is our apex talent, !Stormstream Totem!. As with all apex talents the effects are spread across three nodes:

- The !Stormstream Totem Proc! gives every !Riptide! you cast a chance to upgrade your next !Healing Stream Totem! into a !Stormstream Totem! which heals for 10% more, heals one additional target, and also heals several players for a higher amount as soon as you cast it.
- The second point, the !Stormstream Totem Healing Increase!, buffs all your !Healing Stream Totems! and !Stormstream Totems! by up to 40%.
- The final node is !Stormstream Totem Swiftness! which gives you a guaranteed proc of !Stormstream Totem! every time you use !Natures Swiftness! or !Ancestral Swiftness! and makes your !Stormstream Totem! casts not consume a charge of !Healing Stream Totem!. This means Totemic gets a guaranteed proc every 60 seconds and Farseer every 30.

!Downpour! got a couple of new talents that directly affect it in the form of !Water Expulsion! and !Double Dip!, Farseer got to keep some of the current tier bonuses in the form of !Mystic Knowledge! and Totemic got new effects like !Primal Catalyst!.

Most of the new talents that fill out the spec tree are passive and not super high impact, things like !Calm Waters!, !Crashing Waves! and !Earthen Accord! are not very exciting but still decent filler points to round up the tree. There is also some quality of life improvements in the form of !Instinctive Imbuements!.

## What does it mean?

While the highlight definitely goes to the removal of Cloudburst Totem, all of these combined do represent a decent shift into how shaman is meant to be played. With !Healing Wave! and !Chain Heal! directly competing for your time and mana and having no temporary buffs to either of them, it is most likely that you simply invest your talent points and resources into whichever one of the two is stronger and never even look at the other. As of the time of this writing the base healing of both spells isn't very far apart, but !Healing Wave! has much better talent support and costs half the mana, which makes it a clear winner and results in you never casting !Chain Heal!.

Most of the short cooldowns have been changed to reduce the impact of timing them properly and instead simply focus their power on using them frequently. !Healing Stream Totem! doesn't care as much about the specific second you drop it at and does better when you just send it as often as possible, similarly the new !Unleash Life! doesn't give you as many options as to what spell to improve so you just let your normal casts use it up.

The end result, as expected, is that as long as there is healing to be done you just want to press your short cooldowns as much as possible and fill all the rest of the time casting whatever filler spell is stronger at the moment without even thinking about the other. A very simply and straight forward "just heal" reactive spec.

There are still some more involved points where you can invest time if you are interesting in min maxing however. For Farseer the current playstyle heavily revolves around maximizing !Riptide! spread by abusing your !Healing Wave! casts during !Ascendance! with proper targeting, with the goal of getting as much value out of !Undercurrent! and !Whispering Waves! as possible. This heavily rewards you for good target and spell selection and drops in value fast if you aren't able to minimize downtime.

Totemic has historically been the easier tree and that remains the same, but with the heavier focus and reduced cooldowns on totems it is still possible to play into timings by fishing for procs and alining your cooldowns so that you can drop two !Stormstream Totems! and two !Healing Stream Totems! all together and maximize your !Earthsurge! value abusing !Primal Catalyst!.

Restoration remains a spec with a very simple core that doesn't take a lot of time to learn. It does have some finer details that improve its performance as your skill level increases but the truth is that most of your output does come from the very basics of healing, rather than some deep intricacies exclusive to the spec or convoluted design and interactions.
