Welcome to the Restoration Shaman guide. Restoration is known to be a simple and straight forward healer that just works and lets you play reactively while also having several areas that are harder to master in order for people to go the extra mile when expressing their skill. While the big changes going into Midnight have cut down on the more complex sides of the spec, properly utilizing all your tools and correctly selecting between your short cooldowns and filler spells remains the central point to get the most of your Restoration Shaman gameplay.

Restoration is a very welcoming spec, with a low barrier to entry and able to give results to anyone willing to put a bit of time into learning just the basics of it, but still being fun and engaging enough to keep you wanting to learn more and improve on it over time.
