Going into the pre-patch of midnight we're going to see a rather large overhaul of holy paladin, from talents to spells. Removals, reworks and additions we'll be doing a run-through of all of them!

# Class Tree

![](/img/paladin/Entire%20tree.webp)

## Removed

![](/img/paladin/Removed.webp)

As part of Blizzard's ongoing pruning, most healers had their interrupts removed. Holy paladin was no exception, with !Rebuke! and the follow-up !Punishment! being removed. 

The !Repentance! and !Blinding Light! choice node is now just !Blinding Light!. 

Our two passives !Seal of the Crusader! and !Judgment of Light! were both removed as part of the expansion shift in design philosophy that removed a large portion of passive/trickle healing. 

## Reworked

Hammer of Wrath:

![](/img/paladin/Hammer%20of%20Wrath.webp)

!Hammer of Wrath! now turns !Judgment! into !Hammer of Wrath! for the duration of !Avenging Wrath!, removing some of our button bloat. 

!Hammer of Wrath! keeps any and all modifiers to !Judgment! during this period of time. 

Of Dusk and Dawn

![](/img/paladin/Dusk%20and%20Dawn.webp)

!Of Dusk and Dawn! has been turned into two passive talents, instead of one. The new !Blessing of Dawn! provides a minor Aura of Sacrifice-style aura, while the new !Blessing of Dusk! is a small passive damage reduction. 

## Moved

![](/img/paladin/Holy%20prism.webp)

Holy prism has been added to the class tree and moved away from the spec tree.

![](/img/paladin/Lights%20revocation.webp)

Light's Revocation has been moved up two tiers to take the place of Judgment of the Light instead of being a capstone.

## Added

![](/img/paladin/Added.webp)

!Guided Prayer! and !Armory of Light! are both noteworthy talents, giving us some more passive survivability in a small free, passive heal whenever we dip low and the ability to block all spell damage, including aoe. 

Worth noting is that a shield provides more passive damage reduction against physical damage than 15% parry chance, so this talent only locks us further in to wearing 1-hander plus shield. 

The remaining two talents are both insultingly bad and you won't have to worry about them in any capacity. 

# Herald of the Sun

![](/img/paladin/Herald%20of%20the%20Sun-1.webp)

## Removed

## Reworked

## Moved

# Lightsmith

![](/img/paladin/Lightsmith-1.webp)

One extremely large note here: Authoritative Rebuke still applies to Rebuke, but we had that talent removed several patches ago.

## Added

Three new talents have been added here: !Masterwork!, !Reflection of Radiance! and !Resounding Strike! 

!Masterwork! causes your armaments to apply a lesser armament on the next 3 spell casts. 

!Reflection of Radiance! causes you to have a chance to gain Awakening every time !Holy Bulwark! absorbs damage or !Sacred Weapon! deals damage or healing. 

!Resounding Strike! causes your holy armaments to proc !Hammer and Anvil!, making it much more consistent. 

## Moved

!Hammer and Anvil! has been moved, to the right column and up one row. 

## Reworked

!Blessed Assurance! now causes the effect of your next !Holy Shock! to be increased by 200% because of the removal of !Crusader Strike!.
