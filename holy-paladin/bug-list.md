- !Divine Toll!

Built-in mouseover does not work, it will cast on the targeted enemy regardless of whether you're hovering someone else.

If you cast on yourself, it will fail to fire off all !Holy Shock!s

Occasionally pulls monsters you are not engaged with.

- !Beacon of Light!

!Pillar of Light! healing does not scale with mastery when the talent !Beacon of Faith! is chosen.

Beacons can randomly stop working, why isn't entirely sure but it has rarely happened for over a decade.

- !Hammer and Anvil!

Does not scale with mastery

- !Power of the Silver Hand!

Healing storage is calculated before mastery. A 150k heal with 50% mastery only stores as if you healed for 100k.

Effective healing to healing absorb shields does not count towards your next !Holy Shock!

- !Suns avatar!

Beams and healing can sometimes continue after !Dawnlight! expires.

- !Rising Sunlight!

Can sometimes stop working. You get stacks from casting !Avenging Wrath! and !Divine Toll! but you can not consume them.
Fixed by logging out and in again.

- !Second Sunrise!

The free !Light of Dawn! from !Second Sunrise! can sometimes immediately consume !Divine Purpose! procs from the initial !Light of Dawn!

- !Breaking Dawn!

Having 1 point in !Breaking Dawn! causes the tooltip to state it has a 40yd range despite it only being 25yds.

- !Liberation!

Also reduces the mana cost of !Flash of Light! despite the tooltip not stating this.

- !Light of the Martyr!

Does not create absorb shields if !Holy Shock! healing is absorbed.

Not bugs, but noteworthy:

- Debuff from the trinket Nexus-Kings command can be removed by !Divine Shield! and similar effects.
- !Dawnlight! has a 900ms cooldown to application so with high haste and !Bloodlust! you can cast spenders faster than you can apply more !Dawnlight!s
