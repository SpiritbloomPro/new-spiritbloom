Holy paladin has always been one of the more straight-forward healers, and going forward in Midnight this isn't changing.

We are still a healer strongly favoring reactive healing, strong instant casts on the move while weaving in a mix of casted heals and damaging abilities.

The biggest change in Midnight is the introduction of apex talents - in our case !Beacon of the Savior! - a strong automated beacon that functions indistinguishably from our other beacons - only this one jumps from low health target to low health target!

At the same time !Crusader Strike! has been removed, paving the way for us to no longer be glued to mobs in the same way. We are a melee healer, it's where we do our best work, but your healing won't suffer from taking more of a mid-range stance anymore.

Personally I find this to be a good change, as downtime punishing our throughput isn't something I find to be a very interesting mechanic. You're still casting quite a lot of damaging abilities, so don't worry about "_feeling like a holy priest"_ as some might say.

If that is what you're looking for in a healer, then holy paladin is the healer for you.
