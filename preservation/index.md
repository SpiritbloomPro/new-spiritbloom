Hello and welcome to our Preservation Evoker guide, here you will find all the information you could possibly need to start playing the spec, improve on it, or deepen your understanding of its mechanics.

Preservation is a somewhat complicated healer. It's heavily based around the usage of several short-cooldowns and the empowered spells, it lacks a real spamable healing button, has a shorter range than any other healer and it weirdly goes from having a lot of mobility tools to also being constantly immobile casting long channels. To play Preservation properly you need to adopt a different mindset where you are not a healer that is constantly doing healing but instead go from periods of complex set up and preparation into big bursts and then fall back into your set up phase again for the following damage event.

Using just the right amount of resources to respond to any given situation without overcommiting cooldowns that you will need soon is a key aspect of succeeding as a preservation evoker.
