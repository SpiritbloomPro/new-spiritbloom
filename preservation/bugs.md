## Active Abilities

## Talents

| Talent | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| !Timeless Magic! | !Timeless Magic! Rank 1 incorrectly reduces !Echo!s mana cost by 22.5%, not 15%. Works Properly for !Temporal Anomaly!, !Reversion!, and !Time Dilation! |
| !Essence Well! | Casting !Dream Breath! with any !Echo!'s out will cause multiple instances of !Essence Well!. |
| !Energy Loop! | !Energy Loop! gives a significantly lower amount of mana proportionally on beta vs live despite being no patch notes. |
| !Life Cinders! | When casting !Obsidian Scales! without a target, your !Life Cinders! causes you to use both stacks of !Obsidian Scales!. Functions normally, consumes only 1 charge on cast, when casting !Obsidian Scales! with a friendly targeted. |
| !Nozdormu's Teachings! | !Nozdormu's Teachings! Gives 10 seconds of CDR instead of 5 with no patch notes addressing this as a change. |
| Environmental Damage | Some dungeon bosses, such as Luura, do mostly Environmental Damage to the group. !Golden Hour! and !Rewind! do not get this damage calculated into their healing, making them ineffective on bosses like this. |
