| !Merithras Blessing! | !Merithras Blessing! when !Echo!ed applies a full effectiveness non !Echo!ed !Reversion! on all targets with !Echo!. |
| !Merithras Blessing! | !Merithras Blessing! is not buffed by !Tempo Charged! even though !Merithras Blessing! is a bronze spell. |
| !Merithras Blessing! | Sometimes !Merithras Blessing! will consume both charges of !Reversion! when used. |
| !Merithras Blessing Reversion! | !Merithras Blessing Reversion! currently does not scale with !Echo! effectiveness. |
| !Consume Flame! | !Consume Flame! currently does not log or show on in-game meters. |
| !Consume Flame! | All !Consume Flame! healing heals the target you initially casted the !Verdant Embrace! or !Emerald Blossoms! on, regardless of who they healed. |
| !Titan's Gift! | !Titan's Gift! buffs essence spells that are used that don't consume !Essence Burst!. Casts from !Stasis! and our new Season 1 Tierset as examples. |
| !Threads of Fate! | !Threads of Fate! still exists and is proccing from Chronowarden during !Temporal Burst!. |
| !Timeless Magic! | !Timeless Magic! Rank 1 incorrectly reduces !Echo!s mana cost by 22.5%, not 15%. Works Properly for !Temporal Anomoly!, !Reversion!, and !Time Dilation! |
| !Life Cinders! | !Life Cinders! does not currently work at all. |
| !Mertihras Blessing! | !Merithras Blessing! sometimes will consume 2 store portions of your !Stasis! with a single cast. It will release both !Merithras Blessing!s as normal casts. |
