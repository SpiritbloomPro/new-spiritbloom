## Talents

| Talent | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| !Merithras Blessing Reversion! | !Merithras Blessing Reversion! currently does not scale with !Echo! effectiveness. |
| !Titan's Gift! | !Titan's Gift! buffs essence spells that are used that don't consume !Essence Burst!. Casts from !Stasis! and our new Season 1 Tierset as examples. |
| !Timeless Magic! | !Timeless Magic! Rank 1 incorrectly reduces !Echo!s mana cost by 22.5%, not 15%. Works Properly for !Temporal Anomaly!, !Reversion!, and !Time Dilation! |
| !Essence Well! | Casting !Dream Breath! with any !Echo!'s out will cause multiple instances of !Essence Well!. |
| !Energy Loop! | !Energy Loop! gives a significantly lower amount of mana proportionally on beta vs live despite being no patch notes. |
| !Nozdormu's Teachings! | !Nozdormu's Teachings! Gives 10 seconds of CDR instead of 5 with no patch notes addressing this as a change.
