## History

SpiritbloomPro first originated midways through Dragonflight as a Preservation Evoker website meant to contain extra information that didn't had a good place on the established guides. Over time it grew into its own guide with the idea of presenting information on a more visual way with short clips and videos sprinkled around the content. The Preservation community seemed to enjoy the format a lot so the original guide kept growing and improving over the course of The War Within. By the end of the expansion SpiritbloomPro was an important and valued part of the Wyrmrest Temple preservation community.

With Midnight on the horizon and the impending removal of the spell that gave the site its name, there were a couple of choices to move forwards with: The most obvious one was renaming the site, leaving behind a lot of its history and how it started as. Another option however was to embrace the fact that Spiritbloom was no longer an Evoker specific thing, now that Spiritbloom is no longer a Preservation thing, SpiritbloomPro doesn't have to be either.

It was really a combination of multiple factors all arriving at the correct time, but starting on Midnight SpiritbloomPro now covers a wide range of healing specs and guides. Thanks to the help of multiple prominent members of the communities of different specs, we aim to help as many people as we can while sharing knowledge in our own unique way.

## Goals

Not every single healer spec is covered in our site, and that is intentional. We don't aim to mindlessly cover every possible class and vomit out as much content about them as possible in order to draw in views. The guides on the site exist because someone with a proven track record at being a good player and a sincere want to donate their time in order to help people volunteered to write it.

We will only ever make content that we honestly believe can help people and offer a different perspective that other guides don't already cover, this might be giving a platform to known members of the community of a certain spec that don't already have a place somewhere else, or giving space to someone with good knowledge but no proven track record as a writer to stretch their wings.

We do this because we want to and nothing else, and our goal is that every page reflects the passion each writer has for their spec without any other exterior motivation.

## Result

As a consequence of the previous point, SpiritbloomPro is not monetized in any way! We don't have ads on the site, we don't take donations as a group, and development was made in a way to reduce hosting and maintenance costs as much as possible.

Individual writers might still appreciate your support thought, if you really like the site or a specific guide you can go to our [authors page](/blog/authors) and find the socials for the specific person that wrote the content you are enjoying. This might range from a Twitch channel or Patreon page you can subscribe to to details on how to buy coaching from them, entirely dependant on what that specific person does and wants.

If you aren't sure who wrote a specific piece or just want to talk with someone, feel free to come by [the SpiritbloomPro Discord](http://discord.spiritbloom.pro/) and ask us anything you want, we're always happy to answer questions and hear what you think of our guides.
